# Wiki-path
## _A non-verbal text based experience of Wikipedia_


_Our goal was to have an experience that looks like Wikipedia but feels different._

Wikipedia is a profoundly community based platform and while many extensions focus on the amazing work done by Wikipedians, we wanted to highlight users that spend their times lost on the vasteness of the website.
We wanted to offer Wikipedia users a way to enjoy articles together, catch a glimpse of other people that have taken similar paths before and even maybe communicate if they felt crafty enough.



## Features

- Using WASD, users can navigate the different pages through words. Their footsteps made of letters progressively disappear as time passes but their paths are forever saved.

- Clicking E enables user to highlight a word. Users can highlight as many words as they please or as many words as they need to string their message together.

## Uses

- Try to communicate live with other users live by using the limited vocabulary of the page you are one

- Leave a message for whoever to find. Perhaps a poem, a cryptic entry or a confession for your crush

- Follow an other user to an other page by holding hands together
